### Synchronization
- Control + data flow
- Atomics
- Barriers

### Data Race
Occurs when all hold:
- Multiple threads
- Common memory location
- At least one write
- Concurrent execution

Ways to remove it:
- Execute sequentially
- Privatization / Data replication
- Separating reads and writes by a barrier
- Mutual exclusion

**Example**:

T1
```
flag = 1;
while(flag)
    ...
S1;
```

T2
```
while(!flag)
    ...
S2;
flag = 0;
```

Is there a datarace in this code?

What does the code ensure?

Can mutual exclusion be generalized for N threads?

- If init flag == 0, then S2 executes before S1.
- If init flag == 1, then S2 executes and after that S1 may execute or T1 may hang.

**Data Race**: 
- Thread T1 sets flag to 1 at the beginning and then enters a loop where it only reads the value of flag.
- Thread T2 enters a loop that continues as long as flag is true. Inside this loop, T2 only reads the value of flag. After exiting the loop, T2 writes to flag by setting it to 0.

So, there is no point in the execution where T1 and T2 are simultaneously reading and writing to flag. Therefore, there is no data race in this code.

**Code Assurance**: This code ensures that T1 completes its operation (and executes S1) before T2 starts its operation (and executes S2). This is a basic form of synchronization often used in concurrent programming to prevent data races and ensure the correct order of operations.

**Mutual Exclusion**: 
mutual exclusion can be generalized for N threads. The concept of mutual exclusion is not limited to just two threads; it can be applied to any number of threads to ensure that only one thread at a time can execute a critical section of code.

There are several ways to achieve mutual exclusion for N threads:

1. **Locks/Mutexes**: A lock or mutex can be used to protect a critical section of code. When a thread wants to execute the critical section, it must first acquire the lock. If another thread already holds the lock, the thread will block until the lock is released.

2. **Semaphores**: A semaphore is a more generalized synchronization mechanism that can control access to a critical section for multiple threads. A counting semaphore can be initialized to N, allowing up to N threads to enter the critical section.

3. **Monitors**: A monitor is a synchronization construct that allows threads to have both mutual exclusion and the ability to wait (block) for a certain condition to become true. Monitors provide a mechanism for threads to temporarily give up exclusive access in order to wait for some condition to be met, before regaining exclusive access and resuming their task.

4. **Condition Variables**: Condition variables are another synchronization mechanism that can enable threads to wait until a particular condition occurs.

## Compute the shortest paths
**Example**:
- Let's Compute the Shortest Paths You are given an input graph, and you want to compute the shortest path from Nagpur to every other city.
- Assume that you are given a GPU graph library and the associated routines.
- Each thread operates on a node and settles distances of the neighbors (Bellman-Ford style).

```
__global__ void dssp(Graph g, unsigned *dist){
    unsigned id = threadIdx.x;
    for each n in g.allneighbors(id){
        unsigned altdist = dist[id] + weight(id,n);
        if(altdist < dist[n]){
            dist[n] = altdist;
        }
    }
}
```
