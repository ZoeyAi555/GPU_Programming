### Bakery Algorithm
- Devised by Lamport
- Work with n threads
- maintain FCFS using ever-increasing numebrs

```
bool flag[N];
int label[N];
lock:
    me = tid;
    flag[me] = true;
    label[me]=1+max(label);
    while( <exists> k!=me: flag[k]&&(label[k],k)<(label[me],me))

unlock:
    flag[tid] = false;
```
**max is not atomic**
- The code works in absence of caches
- In presence of caches, mutual exclusion is not guaranteed.
- There are variants to address the issue

- Across warps is similar to CPU: The behavior of this algorithm across warps (groups of threads that execute instructions in lockstep on a GPU) is similar to its behavior on a CPU. Each warp can be considered as a separate thread in the algorithm.
- What happens within warp-threads? Within a warp, threads execute in lockstep, meaning they all execute the same instruction at the same time. If two threads within the same warp try to enter the critical section at the same time, they will get the same label because they compute 1+max(label) simultaneously. However, the tie is broken by the condition (label[k],k)<(label[me],me), which prioritizes the thread with the smaller tid when labels are equal. **tid matters here!**
- Threads get the same label, < prioritizes

- On GPUs, locks are usually prohibited
- High spining cost at large scale
- But locks are feasible
- Locks can also be implemented using atomics
