## Kernels in Streams
- Device memory allocations, kernel launches are made on the currently set device.
- Streams and events are created in association with the currently set device.
```
cudaSetDevice(0); // Set device 0 as current 
cudaStream_t s0;
cudaStreamCreate(&s0); // Create stream s0 on device 0
MyKernel<<<100,64, 0, s0>>>(); // Launch kernel on device 0 in s0 

cudaSetDevice(1); // Set device 1 as current 
cudaStream_t s1;
cudaStreamCreate(&s1); // Create stream s1 on device 1
MyKernel<<<100, 64, 0, s1>>>(); // Launch kernel on device 1 in s1

// This kernel launch will fail:
MyKernel<<<100, 64, 0, q0>>>(); // Launch kernel on device 1 in s0
```

## Memcpy in Streams
- A memory copy succeeds even if it is issued to a stream that is not associated to the current device.Â· - Each device has its own default stream.
    - Commands to default streams of different devices may execute concurrently.

```
cudaSetDevice(0); // Set device 0 as current		
cudaStream_t s0;		
cudaStreamCreate(&s0);	

cudaSetDevice(1);	// Set device 1 as current


// This memory copy is alright.		
cudaMemcpyAsync(dst, src, size,H2D s0);
```

```
cudaSetDevice(0);
K<<<...>>>();
cudaSetDevice(1); 
K<<<...>>>();
// The two kernels may execute concurrently.
```

## Peer Access
- A kernel on one device can dereference a pointer to the memory on another device. 
- This gets internally implemented by unifjying virtual address spaces of the devices.
```
cudaSetDevice(0); 
float *p0;
size_t size = 1024* sizeof(float); 
cudaMalloc(&p0, size); 
K<<<1000,128>>>(p0); 

cudaSetDevice(1);
cudaDeviceEnablePeerAccessor(0,0); 
K<<<1000,128>>>p0
```
