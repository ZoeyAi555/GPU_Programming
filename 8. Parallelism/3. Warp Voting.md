```__all(predicate);```
    - If all warp threads satisfy the predicate.
```__any(predicate);```
    - If any warp threads satisfies the predicate.
```__ballot(predicate);```
    - Which warp threads satisfy the predicate. 
    - Generalizes ```__all``` and ```__any```.

## Warp Voting for atomics
- ```if (condition) atomiclnc(&counter,N)```; 
    - Executed by many threads in a block, but not all. 
    - The contention is high.
    - Can be optimized with __ballot. 
- Leader election
    - Can be thread 0 of each warp (threadldx.x % 32 == 0).
- Leader collects warp-count.
    - __ballot() provides a mask; how do we count bits? 
    -__popc(mask) returns the number of set bits. 
    - __ffs(mask) returns the first set bit (from lsb). 
- Leader performs a single atomicAdd.
