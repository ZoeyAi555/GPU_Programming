## Array
- atomics for index update
- prefix sum for coarse insertion
## Singly linked list
- insertion
- deletion [marking,actual removal]

**Implement**
- Solution 1
    - keep a lock with the list
        - coarse grained sync
        - low concurrency / sequential access
        - easy to implement
        - easy to argue about correctness
- Solution 2
    - keep a lock with each node
        - fine grained sync
        - better concurrency
        - moderately difficult to implement
        - difficult to argue about correctness when multiple nodes are involved

```
void insert(Node *naya){
    ptr = head;
    ptr->lock();
    naya->next = head;
    head = naya;
    ptr->unlock()
}

```
by the time ptr->lock(), head may changed!

Correct:
```
void insert(Node *naya){
    head->lock()
    ptr = head;
    naya->next = head;
    head = naya;
    ptr->unlock()
}

```
head lock first,then copy
