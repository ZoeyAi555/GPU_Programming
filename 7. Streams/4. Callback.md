**Streams with Priorities**

- ```cudaStreamCreatWithPriorityRange(&add1,...,0)```
- ```cudaStreamCreatWithPriorityRange(&add1,...,1)```
- ```cudaStreamCreatWithPriorityRange(&add1,...,2)```
...

- ```cudaDeviceGetStreamPriorityRange(&add1,&add2)```

**Asynchronous Execution**
- is good, but
    - Increases number of concurrent behaviors; makes code understanding difficult
    - Satisfying dependencies becomes difficult
    - With streams, multiple tasks may execute at their own pace, making interception difficult.
- needs callbacks to satisfy dependencies - Let me know!
    - Compare with sleep and wakeup (I am talking about OS threads)

### Stream Callback
- We can insert a callback into a stream.
- The callback function gets executed **on the host** after all previous commands have completed. 
- Callbacks in the **default stream** are executed after all the preceding commands issued in all streams have completed. 
- Callbacks are **blocking**.
